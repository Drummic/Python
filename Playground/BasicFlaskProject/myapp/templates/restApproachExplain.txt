Certainly! The REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture is a set of principles that define how resources are defined and addressed. Resources are anything that can be named, like a user, product, or, in this case, a webpage. They are manipulated using standard HTTP methods, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

In the example of the Flask application with the "Back Home" button, we can see some elements of REST:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Resources
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here, the resources are the pages you are serving, namely `index.html` and `miki.html`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2. Stateless
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In REST, each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. 
The server doesn't store any information about the client's previous requests. In your Flask app, when a user 
clicks the "Back Home" button, their browser sends a new HTTP GET request to the server, and the server responds 
with the `index.html` resource. The server doesn't need to know anything about what the user was doing before they 
clicked the button.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3. Client-Server Architecture
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Flask app follows the client-server model, with the Flask app acting as the server and the user's browser as
the client. The client and server are independent and communicate over HTTP.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4. HTTP Methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this simple example, we are mainly using the HTTP GET method. When the user navigates to a page or clicks the 
"Back Home" button, their browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server. The server responds with the requested 
resource (HTML page).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 5. State Representation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The server responds to a client's request with a representation of the resource's state, such as the HTML and CSS 
needed to render the page.

### 6. URLs as Resource Identifiers

In REST, URLs identify resources. In your Flask app, the URL pattern defined in the `@app.route('/')` decorator 
identifies the `index.html` resource, and the URL pattern in the `@app.route('/miki')` decorator identifies the 
`miki.html` resource.

While this example doesn't fully encapsulate all the principles of REST (such as handling different HTTP 
methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE), it does illustrate some fundamental concepts of RESTful architecture. 
In more complex applications, you might have routes to create, update, and delete resources, all following 
RESTful principles.
